## Challenge Tracker

## Description

As a student participating in a coding boot camp, life can quickly come to you. Between balancing your time with completing the mini projects, recapping the materials learned daily in class, and managing your time to include additional study hours, getting behind on your weekly challenges can become a grave mistake. I've created a Challenge Tracker App to help students better manage their boot camp requirements of completing nineteen of the twenty-one assignments needed to pass the program. The Challenge Tracker not only allows the upcoming developer to track their tasks by list, but developers can also view and delete completed and active tasks. 

## User Story

* As a coding boot camp student juggling many tasks in a short period
* I want the capability of tracking my boot camp challenges
* So that I can successfully manage the requirements for program completion and graduate on time.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Given that I have loaded the Challenge Tracker App
* When I engage with the app features
* Then I am prompted to log in or create a new user account
* When I sign in
* Then I am presented with a dashboard page
* When I add a new task in the text input field
* Then I can save my new study by clicking the save button
* When I click on the All button
* Then I see a list of every task listed under my profile
* When I click the Active button
* Then I see a list of started yet uncompleted task
* When I click the Completed button
* Then I am presented with a list of completed tasks
* When I create a new task
* Then I can click a check box to indicate I've started that task
* When I click the Edit button
* Then I can update the title of the selected task
* When I click the Delete button
* Then I can remove a task
* When I do have a clicker
* Then I can use the Tab + Shift buttons to navigate the app.
